Last Thursday and friday I was trying to figure out an 
alternate way to play tones on multiple buzzers at
once, unsuccessfully.

I spent monday helping people figure out git and
waiting for you to post the journal.

Tuesday and Wednesday, i'm hoping to desipher the 
tone library and figure out how to use it and play
multiple tones at once.

This Thursday and Friday, assuming I have figured out
how to use the tone library, I can start on the song,
which is the easy/fun part.
